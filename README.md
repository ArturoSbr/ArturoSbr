# Welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist with a BSc in Economics, an MSc in Applied Economics and over seven years of experience in the field.

## What I do
As a Data Scientist, I use data to:
1. Make predictions, and
2. Quantify cause-effect relationships.

In the past, I have developed predictive tools to forecast all sorts of phenomena. As an example of my work as a Data Scientist, you can [click here](https://developer.circulodecredito.com.mx/producto/fintech-score-simulacion) to send requests to a credit score I published a few years ago (which is still being consumed by multiple Fintechs all over the world!).

## What I'm working on right now
I am currently developing a PySpark implementation of the [Louvain algorithm for community detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476) for [@BBVA](https://www.bbva.com/). I had never worked with Graphs prior to this, but developing this algorithm has quickly made Graph Theory one of my favorite fields of study. In fact, I have made a few contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx) and [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html) as part of this project!

Hopefully, I'll be able to publish the algorithm as part of [mercury](https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury/) (BBVA's open-source library) soon.

## Take the tour
I'm actually really glad you're here, so I'll try to make it worth your while.

You can:
1. Try out [this Python class](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/understanding-vadr/blob/main/cod/03-lime/lime.py) to interpret *any* kind of NLP model;
2. Check out [this YouTube comment scraper](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/youtube-dislike-count/blob/main/cod/01_data/youtube.py);
3. Review some [entry-level stats](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/statistics-in-python); or
4. Use [this cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/aws-ccp-cheat-sheet) to ace the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;
