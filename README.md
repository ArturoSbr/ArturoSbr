# Welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Arturo and I am a 29 year old Data Scientist with a BSc in Economics, an MSc in Applied Economics and over six years of experience in the field.

## What I do
In short, I use data to:
1. make predictions, and
2. quantify cause-effect relationships.

In the past, I have developed predictive tools to forecast all sorts of phenomena. As an example of my work as a Data Scientist, you can [click here](https://developer.circulodecredito.com.mx/productos/fintech-score) to check out my most recent model.

I have a BSc in Economics as well as an MSc in Applied Economics. Most of the stuff I do here is related to predictive modelling or causal inference.

## Take the tour
I'm actually really glad you're here, so I'll try to make it worth your while.

You can
1. try out [this Python class](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/understanding-vadr/blob/main/cod/03-lime/lime.py) to interpret *any* kind of NLP model;
2. check out [this YouTube comment scraper](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/youtube-dislike-count/blob/main/cod/01_data/youtube.py); or
3. review some [entry-level stats](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/statistics-in-python).

Hope you enjoy your stay (;

## Get in touch
As of right now, I'm really into putting models in production. Hmu if you want to develop any kind of classifier, put it in a container and launch it using a serverless solution (i.e. Google Cloud Run).

Otherwise, you can
1. check out my [website](https://www.soberonarturo.com/);
2. read my [Data Science blog](https://arturosbr.medium.com/); or
3. ask me anything code-related on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9795817/arturo-sbr).

Once again, thank you for being here!
