Hi, my name is Arturo and I am a full-time MSc student.
- ðŸ‘€ I develop predictive tools to forecast all sorts of phenomena using data.
- ðŸš€ I have over four years of professional experience as a Data Scientist. You can [click here](https://developer.circulodecredito.com.mx/productos/fintech-score) to check out my latest model.

I recently became interested in the use of statistics for studying causal effects rather than predictability, so my upcoming repositories will focus on econometrics rather than machine learning.
