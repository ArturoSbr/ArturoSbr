Hi, my name is Arturo and derive insights from data to
1. Make predictions
2. Quantify cause-effect relationships

In the past, I have developed predictive tools to forecast all sorts of phenomena using data. As an example of my work as a Data Scientist, you can [click here](https://developer.circulodecredito.com.mx/productos/fintech-score) to check out my most recent model.

I am currently studying for an MSc in Applied Economics. As a consequence, my latest repositories have focused on Causal Inference rather than Machine Learning.
