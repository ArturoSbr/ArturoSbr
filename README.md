# Welcome!
My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist. It took me a
BSc in Economics and an MSc in Applied Economics to realize I don't know much
about Economics at all! Luckily, I am pretty good at using data to develop
predictive Machine Learning models and estimate cause-effect relations.
I put my brain to good use over at @[BBVA](https://github.com/BBVA).

## What I'm working on
I recently developed a vanilla-PySpark implementation of the [
  Louvain algorithm for community detection
](https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-graph/blob/feature/graph_features/mercury/graph/ml/louvain.py)
and I'm currently working on publishing a series of message-aggregation functions
that make it easy to engineer graph-based fetures.

I've also made a few contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx),
[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html)
in recent months.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;
