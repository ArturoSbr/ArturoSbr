# Welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist working at
[BBVA](https://www.bbva.com/). It took me a BSc in Economics and an MSc in
Applied Economics to realize I don't know much about Economics at all! Luckily,
I am pretty good at using data to make predictions, and quantify cause-effect
relationships.

I am currently developing multiple graph-based vanilla-PySpark solutions.
Namely, I developed the
[Louvain algorithm for community detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476)
as well as a series of message-aggregation functions that make it easy to
engineer graph-based fetures. In developing these solutions, I made a few
contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx) and
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html).
Soon, some of my work will be made available to the whole community as part of
[Mercury](https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury/) - BBVA's open source library.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;
