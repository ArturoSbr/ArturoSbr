# Welcome!
My name is Arturo and I'm a highly caffeinated data scientist with 10 years of
experience in the fields of tech and finance. I love training machine learning models
from scratch and estimating causal effects from non-experimental data. In a nutshell, I
use AI to figure out *what* will happen, and econometrics to understand *why* it's
happening.

I work at @[BBVA](https://www.bbva.com) as a Data Scientist and I also teach
Econometrics at @[ITAM](https://www.itam.mx).

## What I'm working on
I'm currently enrolled in Stanford's professional [Artificial Intelligence Program](
  https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program
) and I should graduate later this year.

I recently developed a vanilla PySpark implementation of the
[Louvain algorithm for community detection](
  https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-graph/blob/master/mercury/graph/ml/louvain.py
)
as well as a [module](
  https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-graph/blob/master/mercury/graph/ml/graph_features.py
) that uses message passing to automatically engineer graph-based features.

I've also made a few contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx),
[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html)
in recent months.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;
