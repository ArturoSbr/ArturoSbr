# Welcome!
My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist with over 10 years of XP
in the fields of tech and finance. I have a BSc and an MSc in Economics, but I mainly
use data to develop predictive Machine Learning models and estimate cause-effect
relations.

I work at @[BBVA](https://www.bbva.com) as a Data Scientist and I'm currently teaching
Econometrics to Master's students at @[ITAM](https://www.itam.mx).

## What I'm working on
I'm currently enrolled in Stanford's professional [Artificial Intelligence Program](
  https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program
) and I should graduate later this year.

I recently developed a vanilla PySpark implementation of the
[Louvain algorithm for community detection](
  https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-graph/blob/feature/graph_features/mercury/graph/ml/louvain.py
)
as well as a [module](
  https://github.com/BBVA/mercury-graph/blob/master/mercury/graph/ml/graph_features.py
) that uses message passing to automatically engineer graph-based features.

I've also made a few contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx),
[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html)
in recent months.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;
