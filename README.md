# Welcome to my GitHub!
My name is Arturo and I am a 29 year old Data Scientist with a BSc in Economics, an MSc in Applied Economics and over six years of experience in the field.

## What I do
As a Data Scientist, I use data to:
1. Make predictions, and
2. Quantify cause-effect relationships.

In the past, I have developed predictive tools to forecast all sorts of phenomena. As an example of my work as a Data Scientist, you can [click here](https://developer.circulodecredito.com.mx/productos/fintech-score) to check out my most recent model.

I have a BSc in Economics as well as an MSc in Applied Economics. Most of the stuff I do here is related to predictive modelling or causal inference.

## Take the tour
I'm actually really glad you're here, so I'll try to make it worth your while.

You can:
1. Try out [this Python class](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/understanding-vadr/blob/main/cod/03-lime/lime.py) to interpret *any* kind of NLP model;
2. Check out [this YouTube comment scraper](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/youtube-dislike-count/blob/main/cod/01_data/youtube.py);
3. Review some [entry-level stats](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/statistics-in-python); or
4. Use [this cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ArturoSbr/aws-ccp-cheat-sheet) to ace the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

Hope you enjoy your stay (;

## Get in touch
As of right now, I'm really into deploying data products in the cloud. Hit me up if you want to develop any kind of classifier, put it in a container and launch it using a serverless solution (i.e. Google Cloud Run).

Otherwise, you can:
1. Check out my [website](https://www.soberonarturo.com/);
2. Read my [Data Science blog](https://arturosbr.medium.com/); or
3. Ask me anything code-related on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9795817/arturo-sbr).

Once again, thank you for being here!
